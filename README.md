# How we setup the bootstrap with sass in our project
1. For using bootstrap with SASS we need to install nodejs first 
2. After installing nodejs install bootstrap with npm "npm i bootstrap@5.3.1"
3. Created Sass folder and create a file main.scss 
4. Import bootstrap into main.sass from installed node_modules
5. Now you can use bootstrap into sass



# how you can run Project
1. install node with this URL "https://nodejs.org/en"
2. Clone the project from repo Go to project directory where pakage.json exists and open any terminal and  run this  "npm install"
3. By running this command it will install the all pakages our project needs.
4. we can skip this step and can move node modules also with project but this is not good way.
5. we will move just pakages.json file and other file except node_modules. The node_modules added in gitignore file 


# Some Notes
1. As mentioned above i installed bootstrap 5.3.1 version with npm so i commented the other bootstrap CDNs we dont need them now because i installed same verison of bootstrap which you are using before. I also import the bootstrap into test2.html. it was good to add with npm because for sass it is necessary.

# Bootstrap Spinner
 i created a logic using JS events and refer to class now where you will add this class "usespinner"
 and then you will find the spinner before loaded the next content
